# Basegulp 
Basegulp is a ready made mini-project for coding a front end website on vanilla js
## Installation
Use the package manager [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install the libraries from package.json .
```bash
npm i
```
## Usage
Just write the code and feel free to include the files (pre-made by me) to make your life easier.
## How does it work
Before you're writting your code, write in console `gulp` and in the browser will open the web page you are coding.

If you want to add new html, that are going to be in other html, files put before them `_`, it should look like this `_filename.html` .
